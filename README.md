# TagToExcel

Created in python, put the executable in the same folder as all the music files. Then run the program. The GUI interface created using Tkinter will allow for ease of use. This will then allow for all the tags to be wrtiten into an .xslx file. Change all the tags that you need save the file. Finally, using the executable to write the tags using the buttons. 

I made this to solve my own issue of ripping all my old music from disk's and wanted it to have all the music metadata populated correctly in my MP3 player.

Final executable found in Output folder.
